This project talks about the different types of search algorithms that are used in machine learning, and takes a practical approach to understanding them. 
The report talks about different strategies such as BFS, DFS, A*, Forward A*, Backward A*, and Repeated Backward A*.
In the main.java and cord.java files, you will see a project that uses an agent and a target, and tries to find the shortest path from agent to target.
Using the different methods, calculations are made based on how many moves it would take and how fast the agent can get to the target.
